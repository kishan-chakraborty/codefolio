The goal of the paper is to autonomously discover powerful RL algorithms which are able to outperform state-of-the art algorithms like PPO, etc. This is achieved by meta-learning from experiences of large number of agents across diverse environments. One essential component of RL is a rule that updates the predictions $\textit{i.e.}$ the
